    <h2>This is a recipe to prepare an alternative and very tasty pizza</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> This yeastless pizza crust starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder:</strong> Without yeast, the pizza dough needs baking powder to rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the flavor and strengthens the gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> You&#39;ll need Â½ cup of fat-free milk.</li>
        <li><strong>Olive oil: </strong> Olive oil locks in moisture and keeps the dough from drying out.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Mix the dry ingredients, then stir in the wet ingredients until a dough forms.</li>
       <li>Turn out the dough and knead. </li>
       <li>Shape the dough into a ball and let rise.</li>
       <li>Roll the dough out into a circle.</li>
       <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
       <li>Bake the crust in the preheated oven for 8 minutes.</li>
       <li>Top with your favorite toppings and bake until the crust is golden brown, about 10 to 15 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
